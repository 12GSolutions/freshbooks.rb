=Freshbooks API for Ruby

Freshbooks is a popular web-based invoicing application for small and medium businesses. This library makes it easy to write Ruby code that communicates with your Freshbooks account using their public XML-based API.

=Installation

This library is distributed as a single file: freshbooks.rb. Put it wherever you keep your other library files. For Rails applications, this would be /lib.

  require 'lib/freshbooks'

For examples, read on.

=Examples

Before doing anything, you need to initialize a base Freshbooks object with your account details.

  account = Freshbooks.new('YourCompany', 'username', 'password')

To add a new client, instantiate a new Freshbooks::Client object and send it to Freshbooks#add_client.

  client = Freshbooks::Client.new

  client.first_name    = 'Donna'
  client.last_name     = 'Changstein'
  client.username      = 'dchangstein'
  client.email_address = 'dchangstein@xyz.com'
  client.orgname       = 'XYZ Corp'

  account.add_client(client)

Basically, client attributes are the same as specified in the API, except that where the API uses CamelCase, I've inserted underscores in an attempt to stick with Ruby coding conventions.

Modifying client details is just as easy. Just make sure the username is identical, and you're golden.

  client.last_name = 'Chang'

  account.modify_client(client)

More examples on their way.
